<h1>Final Project</h1>

<h2>I have created a program that lets the user play the game of Blackjack. The object of the game is to get closest to 21 without going over. faces count as 10 and the ace counts as an 11 or a 1. You play against the dealer who must hit until he has 17 or more. Dealer stays on a soft 17 and a blackjack pays out 1.5 times your bet.<br><br>
To play the game you will first have to click on the start button to 
bring you to the start of the game. You will then have the option to place a bet on your first hand by clicking the colored chips on the top left of the screen. Your current bet will be labeled on the bottom left of the screen along with an option to decrease your bet by 5. After you have the bet you would like to place, click the deal button on the top right to deal out two cards to the user and one to the dealer. You can then decide to click the hit button to add another card to your total or the stay button which will add cards to the dealer until his total is 17 or more. After you hit stay, a message will come up telling you if you have won or losed along with another button labled "bet" which you can click to take you back to the screen to place another bet for your second hand.<h2>
